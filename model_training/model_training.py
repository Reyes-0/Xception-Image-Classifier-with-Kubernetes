# U ONLY NEED ONE MODEL CHOOSE THE MODEL WITH THE BEST( MOST LIKELY THE XCEPTION MODEL)
# Need to take the raw data from the files, and then train, also need a variable assigned to the model to do inference 
# like u finished training the model (trained_model = model.train()) so u assign it to a variable and the inference.py from import that trained_model just like CAIE
